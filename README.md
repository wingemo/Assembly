# Why Learn Assembly Language?
People learn assembly language for various reasons. The most obvious one may be to learn about the computer’s architecture and operating system. You may want to learn more about the computer you work with and about the way computer languages generate machine code. Because of assembly’s close relationship to machine language, it is closely tied to the computer’s hardware and software.

# Applications

### LEDs
The program should first turn on all the odd red lights and then the even red lights. 
Every fifth time all the green lights turn on. This should be repeated 
infinitely until the program is canceled outside. 

### JTAG UART
A program in Assembly that reads from the JTAG port
and then send back the same data to the JTAG port. i.e. You should be able to see in the UART window what
you type in the keyboard.
