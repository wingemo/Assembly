# Machine instructions ðŸ”­
A compiler for a high-level language could convert high level code 
into assembler and a secondary utility could convert assembler into 
what you call machine code. A compiler could also produce 
machine code directly ~ [Richard](https://www.google.com). 

This is a project where i convert high level code to machine instructions becouse i want to understand how things work behind the scenes.
