# About the project

### LEDs.c
The program should first turn on all the odd red lights and then the even red lights. 
Every fifth time all the green lights turn on. This should be repeated 
infinitely until the program is canceled outside. 

### JTAG.c
A program in Assembly that reads from the JTAG port
and then send back the same data to the JTAG port.

i.e. You should be able to see in the UART window what
you type in the keyboard.
